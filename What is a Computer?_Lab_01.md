## What is a Computer?

A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the result as output. It renders output just after performing mathematical and logical operations and can save the output for future use. It can process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. The term "computer" is derived from the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.

A computer is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of solutions through integrated hardware and software components. It works with the help of programs and represents the decimal numbers through a string of binary digits. It also has a memory that stores the data, programs, and result of processing. The components of a computer such as machinery that includes wires, transistors, circuits, hard disk are called hardware. Whereas, the programs and data are called software.

It is believed that the Analytical Engine was the first computer which was invented by Charles Babbage in 1837. It used punch cards as read-only memory. Charles Babbage is also known as the father of the computer.

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs mathematical calculations and logical operations.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdb81b99-c614-49c3-b1c6-f2b6c78797f6)

  


**Example**: In a simple arithmetic operation like addition, the CPU retrieves the numbers to be added from memory, processes them using the ALU, and stores the result back in memory.


### Memory

Memory in a computer system is used to store data temporarily or permanently. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/269e7e9c-d0d7-4f46-b952-2e13d101c602)


There are two main types:
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: Volatile memory used for temporary storage of data and instructions that the CPU is currently using. Once the power is turned off, all data in RAM is lost.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/165d3fd7-fbac-41d8-bb4f-b01ceafc5a84)


- **Read-Only Memory (ROM)**: Non-volatile memory that contains permanent instructions for booting the computer. Data in ROM is not lost when the power is turned off.

## Working Mechanism of a Computer

The working of a computer can be broken down into four main stages:

1. **Input**: Data is entered into the computer via input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse).
2. **Processing**: The CPU processes the input data according to programmed instructions.
3. **Storage**: Processed data can be stored temporarily in RAM or permanently in storage devices.
4. **Output**: The results of the processing are outputted through output devices (e.g., monitor, printer).

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b67bf9e-f56c-405f-9797-deb2113330e1)


This cycle is often referred to as the **IPO cycle** (Input, Processing, Output).

## History of Computers

The first counting device was used by the primitive people. They used sticks, stones and bones as counting tools. As human mind and technology improved with time more computing devices were developed. Some of the popular computing devices starting with the first to recent ones are described below;

### Abacus
The history of computer begins with the birth of abacus which is believed to be the first computer. It is said that Chinese invented Abacus around 4,000 years ago.

It was a wooden rack which has metal rods with beads mounted on them. The beads were moved by the abacus operator according to some rules to perform arithmetic calculations. Abacus is still used in some countries like China, Russia and Japan. An image of this tool is shown below;

### Napier's Bones
It was a manually-operated calculating device which was invented by John Napier (1550-1617) of Merchiston. In this calculating tool, he used 9 different ivory strips or bones marked with numbers to multiply and divide. So, the tool became known as "Napier's Bones. It was also the first machine to use the decimal point.

### Pascaline
Pascaline is also known as Arithmetic Machine or Adding Machine. It was invented between 1642 and 1644 by a French mathematician-philosopher Biaise Pascal. It is believed that it was the first mechanical and automatic calculator.

Pascal invented this machine to help his father, a tax accountant. It could only perform addition and subtraction. It was a wooden box with a series of gears and wheels. When a wheel is rotated one revolution, it rotates the neighboring wheel. A series of windows is given on the top of the wheels to read the totals. An image of this tool is shown below;

**The evolution of computers can be traced back several centuries and can be categorized into several generations:**

# Generations of Computers
A generation of computers refers to the specific improvements in computer technology with time. In 1946, electronic pathways called circuits were developed to perform the counting. It replaced the gears and other mechanical parts used for counting in previous computing machines.

In each new generation, the circuits became smaller and more advanced than the previous generation circuits. The miniaturization helped increase the speed, memory and power of computers. 
**There are five generations of computers which are described below;**

### 1. First Generation (1940-1956):

   The first generation (1946-1959) computers were slow, huge and expensive. In these computers, vacuum tubes were used as the basic components of CPU and memory. These computers were mainly depended on batch operating system and punch cards. Magnetic tape and paper tape were used as output and input devices in this generation;

**Some of the popular first generation computers are;**

**ENIAC** ( Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
**EDVAC** ( Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer)
**UNIVACI** ( Universal Automatic Computer)
**IBM-701**
**IBM-650**
   - **Vacuum Tubes**: Used for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory.

### Computers are divided into different types based on different criteria. Based on the size, a computer can be divided into five types:

**1. Micro Computer**
**2. Mini Computer**
**3. Mainframe Computer**
**4. Super Computer**
**5. Workstations**

   ### 1. Micro Computer:
It is a single-user computer which has less speed and storage capacity than the other types. It uses a microprocessor as a CPU. The first microcomputer was built with 8-bit microprocessor chips. The common examples of microcomputers include laptops, desktop computers, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablets, and smartphones. Microcomputers are generally designed and developed for general usage like browsing, searching for information, internet, MS Office, social media, etc.

### 2. Mini Computer:
Mini-computers are also known as "Midrange Computers." They are not designed for a single. They are multi-user computers designed to support multiple users simultaneously. So, they are generally used by small businesses and firms. Individual departments of a company use these computers for specific purposes. For example, the admission department of a University can use a Mini-computer for monitoring the admission process.

### 3. Mainframe Computer:
It is also a multi-user computer capable of supporting thousands of users simultaneously. They are used by large firms and government organizations to run their business operations as they can store and process large amounts of data. For example, Banks, universities, and insurance companies use mainframe computers to store the data of their customers, students, and policyholders, respectively.

### 4. Super Computer:
Super-computers are the fastest and most expensive computers among all types of computers. They have huge storage capacities and computing speeds and thus can perform millions of instructions per second. The super-computers are task-specific and thus used for specialized applications such as large-scale numerical problems in scientific and engineering disciplines including applications in electronics, petroleum engineering, weather forecasting, medicine, space research and more. For example, NASA uses supercomputers for launching space satellites and monitoring and controlling them for space exploration.

### 5. Work stations:
It is a single-user computer. Although it is like a personal computer, it has a more powerful microprocessor and a higher-quality monitor than a microcomputer. In terms of storage capacity and speed, it comes between a personal computer and minicomputer. Work stations are generally used for specialized applications such as desktop publishing, software development, and engineering designs.

# Benefits of Using a Computer:

A computer allows you to store a large amount of information, e.g., you can store your projects, ebooks, documents, movies, pictures, songs, and more.
### Organized Data and Information:
It not only allows you to store data but also enables you to organize your data. For example, you can create different folders to store different data and information and thus can search for information easily and quickly.
### Improves your abilities:
It helps write good English if you are not good at spelling and grammar. Similarly, if you are not good at math, and don't have a great memory, you can use a computer to perform calculations and store the results.
### Assist the physically challenged: 
It can be used to help the physically challenged, e.g., Stephen Hawking, who was not able to speak used computer to speak. It also can be used to help blind people by installing special software to read what is on the screen.
### Keeps you entertained:
You can use the computer to listen to songs, watch movies, play games and more.

**The computer has become a part of our life. There are plenty of things that we do in a day are dependent on a computer. Some of the common examples are as follows:**

### ATM:
While withdrawing cash from an ATM, you are using a computer that enables the ATM to take instructions and dispense cash accordingly.
### Digital currency: 
A computer keeps a record of your transactions and balance in your account and the money deposited in your account in a bank is stored as a digital record or digital currency.
### Trading: 
Stock markets use computers for day to day trading. There are many advanced algorithms based on computers that handle trading without involving humans.

### Smartphone: 
The smartphone that we use throughout the day for calling, texting, browsing is itself a computer.
### VoIP: 
All voice over IP communication (VoIP) is handled and done by computers.

## Conclusion
